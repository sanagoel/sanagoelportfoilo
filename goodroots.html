                <h3> Reflection</h3>
                <p>Throughout the five weeks of this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of research in shaping effective design decisions. I learned how to build a cohesive brand identity through strong art direction and visual design. Developing the website strengthened my skills in prototyping, wire framing, and interaction design, as we focused on creating an experience that was both intuitive and engaging. The microsite combined visuals like images, videos, and animations with text to communicate the essence of the festival in a way that felt dynamic and user-centered.</p>
